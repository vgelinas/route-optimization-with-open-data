# Route optimization with transit open data

This project collects live transit data from public APIs, which I'm using to experiment with route optimization, forecasting and anomaly detection methods. This is a work in progress.

I'm working here with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) bus & streetcar data, but any transit agency covered by the [NextBus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NextBus) [web API](https://retro.umoiq.com/xmlFeedDocs/NextBusXMLFeed.pdf) can be used.

## Data
Location data is collected every few minutes from a fleet of ~2000 vehicles, with week-long retention.
